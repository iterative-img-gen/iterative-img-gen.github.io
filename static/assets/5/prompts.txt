Step 1: A pixel art image shows a tiny pine tree with two carrots positioned in front of it. There is also a house in the scene.
	Step 2: Edit the pixel art image by making the large pine tree significantly smaller to be tiny, while maintaining the position of the two carrots in front of it and the house in the scene.
	Step 3: Edit the image to clearly show exactly two distinct, standard-sized carrots. Reposition these two carrots so they are located directly in front of the base of the tiny pine tree, and ensure the house remains in the scene.
