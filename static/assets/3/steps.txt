	Step 1: In a watercolor painting, there is a tiny broccoli, one sushi roll, a red pizza, and four cactuses. Additionally, there is a large carrot.
	Step 2: Add one more cactus to the watercolor painting so that there are exactly four cactuses in the scene, keeping the existing large carrot, tiny broccoli, one sushi roll, and red pizza.
	Step 3: Add a tiny watercolor representation of broccoli to the image, ensuring it is positioned near the large carrot or sushi roll, while retaining the existing arrangement of the large carrot, one sushi roll, red pizza slice, and four cactuses.
	Step 4: Remove one of the two identical columnar cactuses located on the far left side of the image, ensuring exactly four distinct cactuses remain in the scene. Preserve the existing large carrot, sushi roll, red pizza slice, and tiny broccoli.
