Step 1: A woman sits at a table, typing on a red laptop. A black chicken with a glass-like texture stands next to her. A large spider hangs from the ceiling above them. The image has an impressionist style.
Step 2: Refine the black chicken standing next to the woman on the table, ensuring it has a reflective, glass-like, jewel-like texture, while maintaining the impressionist style of the overall scene.
Step 3: Edit the black chicken on the table to clearly display a highly reflective, faceted, glass-like or crystalline texture, making it look like a black jewel sculpture, while preserving the impressionistic style of the surrounding scene.
